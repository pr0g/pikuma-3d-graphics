# Pikuma - 3D Graphics Programming from Scratch

An implementation of the [_3D Graphics Programming from Scratch_](https://pikuma.com/courses/learn-3d-computer-graphics-programming) course by Gustavo Pezzi.

This implementation uses CMake as the build system (instead of Makefiles) and contains quite a few differences to the reference implementation (some possible improvements and some things that I regret on reflection ðŸ˜…).

> Note: Check out [3drenderer](https://github.com/gustavopezzi/3drenderer) by [gustavopezzi](https://github.com/gustavopezzi) for the reference implementation.

The course was great fun and an excellent refresher on the fundamentals of 3D graphics. I highly recommend giving it a try! ðŸ™‚
